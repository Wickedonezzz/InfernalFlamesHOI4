SHO_Defensive_Lines: "Defensive Lines"
SHO_Defensive_Lines_desc: "Considering our almost non-existent army, it would be wise to invest in defensive lines on our borders. One cost-effective yet reliable option could be the installation of concrete fortifacations along our borders."
SHO_Anti_Aircraft_Positions: "Anti Aircraft Positions"
SHO_Anti_Aircraft_Positions_desc: "Considering our almost non-existent air force, it would be wise to invest in measures to ensure the safety of our homes. One cost-effective yet reliable option could be the installation of anti-aircraft flak cannons."
SHO_Civilian_Airstrips: "Civilian Airstrips"
SHO_Civilian_Airstrips_desc: "Despite the small size of our air force, it is crucial to ensure reliable takeoff capabilities during times of war. Local airports can serve as a saving grace in such situations. Additionally, if our air force were to expand in the future, these airports would become even more valuable."
SHO_Construction_of_Radar_Towers: "Construction of Radar Towers"
SHO_Construction_of_Radar_Towers_desc: "To ensure optimal efficiency for our air force and flak cannons, they must be able to identify their targets effectively. Radar towers and early warning systems can serve as ideal solutions to fill these gaps."
SHO_The_Northern_Lights: "Northern Lights"
SHO_The_Northern_Lights_desc: "The military staff has indeed concluded that Denmark poses a threat to our existence. It is evident that they will attempt to invade our lands as soon as they get the opportunity. Fortunately, their border with us is one of the smallest that could exist."
SHO_Prepare_For_The_Danes: "Imminent Danish Threat"
SHO_Prepare_For_The_Danes_desc: "With our realization of the Danish threat, we shall commence the construction of the initial fortification lines to halt their advance. However, our eternal concern will be the possibility of the guards themselves deciding to overthrow us."
SHO_Fortify_The_Coastlines: "Fortify Vital Coastlines"
SHO_Fortify_The_Coastlines_desc: "The coastlines of our nation represent a vulnerable point, as any enemy force would undoubtedly target the sandy beaches, which provide easy access for invasion. Despite not being the most defensible locations, it is crucial to secure and maintain control over the ports."
SHO_Fortify_Copenhagen: "Fortifying Copenhagen"
SHO_Fortify_Copenhagen_desc: "By capturing Copenhagen, we have demonstrated that we can still fight with the spirit of our old nation during the Great War. However, capturing a city holds little significance if we cannot sustain our hold on it."
SHO_The_German_Shadows: "German Shadows"
SHO_The_German_Shadows_desc: "The Germans desire nothing but our demise; they are unwilling to engage in any form of negotiation or recognize our legitimacy as a state. We must remain vigilant and cautious, keeping a watchful eye on their actions, as their intentions may be shrouded in darkness, leaving us with little visibility."
SHO_Holding_The_Border: "Holding Our Border"
SHO_Holding_The_Border_desc: "The borders of our nation must be fortified as a matter of urgency. The Germans have amassed troops and heavily armored vehicles along the borders, indicating a looming threat. Time is running short, and we must take immediate action to strengthen our defenses."
SHO_The_Kiel_River: "The Kiel River"
SHO_The_Kiel_River_desc: "It would be unrealistic to believe that we can successfully hold off the Germans solely on our border. Therefore, Protocol 327 should be enacted, and fortification lines along the Great Canal should be constructed. If the Germans manage to breach this line, it will be incredibly difficult to impede their progress."
SHO_Brandenburg_A_Fortress: "Brandenburg A Fortress"
SHO_Brandenburg_A_Fortress_desc: "The capture of Brandenburg represents one of our greatest achievements thus far. When was the last time Berlin was taken by a foreign force? The city must be rebuilt and fortified thoroughly to ensure its impregnability."

SHO_Fixing_The_Foundations_desc: "The government's regulations on corporations have severely hindered their ability to generate revenue, resulting in business closures and subsequent unemployment. It is imperative that these regulations are replaced before irreparable damage is done to the industrial sector as a whole."
SHO_Workers_Suffrage_Programs: "Workers Suffrage Programs"
SHO_Workers_Suffrage_Programs_desc: "The workers serve as the backbone of the industry itself. If we fail to provide them with assistance to navigate their way out of dire circumstances, they may continue to gravitate towards radical ideals, as was witnessed during the 1927 revolution."
SHO_Providing_Farming_Equipment: "Providing Farming Equipment"
SHO_Providing_Farming_Equipment_desc: "The farmers in the rural countryside are still employing inefficient methods, resulting in low farm yields. Currently, it requires an entire family's effort to plow a single field. However, if we provide them with modern tools and training, the agricultural yield can significantly increase."

SHO_Bomb_Proof_Centers: "Bomb Proof Centers"
SHO_Bomb_Proof_Centers_desc: "The small size of our country presents a challenge when it comes to the visibility and vulnerability of factories and other critical assets. Being easily spotted and targeted by potential adversaries puts these assets at a higher risk of destruction during times of conflict."
SHO_Ramping_Up_Production: "Ramping Up Production"
SHO_Ramping_Up_Production_desc: "Given the need to strengthen our defense capabilities, the production of weapons becomes a necessity. To ensure the readiness and self-sufficiency of our military, we must prioritize the domestic production of weapons and armaments"

SHO_The_Flood_MKUltra: "Flood MKUltra Program"
SHO_The_Flood_MKUltra_desc: "The Flood MKULTRA is a formidable battle tank equipped with thick armor plating and destructive firepower. It features a 75mm turret and a front-facing 12.7mm anti-infantry machine gun. The tank's heavy armor provides excellent protection but reduces its top speed. However, this trade-off allows it to withstand significant amounts of damage on the battlefield."
SHO_Sturmtiger_Protoypes: "Sturmtiger Protoypes"
SHO_Sturmtiger_Protoypes_desc: "A relatively recent addition to the Kiel arsenal is the "Sturmtiger," a specialized tank that features a front-facing mortar cannon designed for demolishing structures effectively. Based on the well-established Stug Class, the HC series of tanks brings enhanced armor and more reliable treads. The standout feature of the Sturmtiger is its formidable 250mm short-barreled Hades mortar."

SHO_Antagonizing_The_Shadow_Marxists_desc: "The Marxists remain deeply rooted in the rural towns, making it imperative to devise a strategic plan to deal with their presence effectively. One approach could involve luring these radicals out by flaunting their captured leaders. Utilizing the previously captured radio stations, we can employ clever tactics to trick them into gathering at pre-planned areas."
SHO_The_New_Freikorps_State: "The New Freikorps State"
SHO_The_New_Freikorps_State_desc: "With the northern lands and our internal politics stabilized, we can now initiate the process of liberating our brothers in Europe.

###Army
SHO_Funding_The_Branches: "Military Funding"
SHO_Funding_The_Branches_desc: "The state of our military has been a cause for concern, as it has been slowly withering away due to insufficient funding. However, with even a portion of our GDP allocated to the military, we can establish and maintain a well equipped and formidable defense force."
SHO_Begin_The_Excercises: "Begin The Excercises"

SHO_A_Dominant_Army: "A Dominant Army"
SHO_A_Dominant_Army_desc: "The most important of the three branches is the army itself. It is the driving force and the defender. Without a capable army, the docks and airfields will be lost in an instant."

SHO_Start_The_Frederick_Reserves_desc: "Due to our small population, the military will be limited in the manpower we are able to field. But luckily, there have been similar problems in the past with adequate solutions. A dual reserve system is the perfect thing for Kiel."
SHO_The_KielKrieg: "The KielKrieg"
SHO_The_KielKrieg_desc: "Though one of the most neglected branches, the navy is still a vital asset. Due to our lands being mostly composed of beaches, the navy can protect almost any of our territories. They will also prove very useful if we have to cross a strait."
SHO_Walls_of_Steel: "Walls of Steel"
SHO_Walls_of_Steel_desc: "The relatively small size of our fleet requires us to group it all together in one task force for the majority of the time. If we can ensure good cooperation between each ship, it could prove substantial."

SHO_Marching_North: "Marching North"
SHO_Marching_North_desc: "While the lands of Lithuania might seem like a more favorable approach, we cannot act on it. The Polish wouldn't let such a thing happen, no matter the situation.

#### IDEAS ####

SHO_hamburg_legacy: "Spectre of the Hamburg Commune"
SHO_hamburg_legacy_desc: "The short-lived Collectivist revolt in Hamburg during 1927 was barely put down by the occupying Danish forces. The legacy of the Hamburg Commune lives on, 9 years later. Many socialist organizations still exist, awaiting a moment to rise up against their Danish oppressors once more."
SHO_nazbol_gang: "National Collectivism"
SHO_nazbol_gang_desc: "Hamburg has become the birthplace of the doctrine of National Collectivism. Encompassing a variation of Radical Nationalist and Collectivist ideals, the National Collectivists will likely be the ones to light the fires of revolution to overthrow the Danish Occupiers."
SHO_political_repression: "Political Repression"
SHO_political_repression_desc: "Despite that Democratic movements have achieved Democracy in Denmark itself, the Kiel Zone has remained under a Transitional Government for aproxmiately 6 years now. Many rights still have not been restored, and the Danish Transitional Government actively attempts to dismantle all Collectivist organziations before further reform."

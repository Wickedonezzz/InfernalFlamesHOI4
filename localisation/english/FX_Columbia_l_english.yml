###Events n stuff homie 
afanews.1.d:0 "\n\n\n\n\n\n\\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA prototype nuclear reactor has experienced a catastrophic explosion, resulting in significant radiation leaks. As a precautionary measure, the surrounding areas and the nearby city housing the reactor have been evacuated. These reactors are typically kept confidential, but public distrust is rising. It is estimated that the potential casualties could exceed 60,000. The question remains. What caused this meltdown? There are rumors circulating that an armed civilian, equipped with nothing more than a shotgun, may have triggered the explosion. However, these claims have not been verified, and investigations are ongoing to determine the actual cause of the incident. In the meantime, a decision has been made to plant a flower for every life lost in the tragedy. This small gesture serves as a symbol of remembrance and a reminder to cherish and protect life during these difficult times."
shoshon.1.d:0 "The Indians of the West have betrayed us! Someone get me goddamn Jensen on the line! Send the National Guard. Just do something, for Lord's sake! We cannot fail America like the previous government."
afadec.1.t:0 "Snap Elections"
afadec.1.d:0 "A sudden election has been called by the "Folk Assembly". They claim this election will contain no acts of fraud and secure a vote of confidence. Though the elections are already being criticized due to the fact that many have found themselves unable to vote. The reason cited by the "FA" is that those who are uneducated or have no true holdings or "values" do not deserve to represent our nation."
afadec.1.a:0 "A clear win by the Folkisch Republikans"
afadec.1.b:0 "A clear win by the Christian Coalition"
afadec.2.d:0 "America has reentered the world stage after its relatively short civil war. They have come to us with an offer of an alliance. Although we were close with the Federalists, aligning ourselves with the new America could potentially make us many enemies. However, if the Marxists are to be taken down, it might just be worth considering."

afadec.2.a:0 "We Will Gladly Join"
afadec.2.b:0 "No Thanks, Bro"
afadec.3.d:0 "The lands to the north are still not within the grasp of any Europeans. This presents a grand opportunity for a new wave of land grabs.

afadec.8.d:0 "With the recapture of Washington D.C. and the reopening of elections, we have reached a pivotal moment where the decision regarding the final capital region arises. There are multiple options to consider. Moving the capital to D.C. could serve to legitimize our claim to America. On the other hand, keeping it in its current location may acknowledge the significance of the region in winning the war. Alternatively, relocating the capital to the far north could potentially secure a stronger hold over Canada itself. Ultimately, the decision should weigh various factors and considerations, such as symbolism, practicality, and geopolitical implications."

afathreat.5.t:0 "Those Foolish Brits...."
afathreat.5.d:0 "The British backed administration in Canada has succumbed to our tactics! They have indeed conceded the West Coast to us under the threat of war.

afathreat.6.t:0 "The AFA Wants To Offer Central America and Mexico"

afathreat.9.t:0 "The American's Demand Our Submission"
afathreat.9.d:0 "America has extended an offer to liberate us from our British overlords and prevent the impending annexation by Australia. Whether the Americans would prove to be superior to the British remains to be seen. We can only discover the answer through time and experience."

afathreat.10.t:0 "Those Damn Kiwis"

afathreat.13.d:0 "The new American government exhibits an even greater interest compared to its predecessors. This situation poses significant danger, as the handover of Taiwan might only delay their justification for war, rather than prevent it entirely."
afathreat.14.d:0 "The Japanese have rejected our fair demands, indicating their preference for immediate warfare. Perhaps they believed we were bluffing or underestimated our resolve."
afathreat.15.d:0 "The tyranny of America has resurfaced. Their interference in South America has been evident before, but this time it is even more apparent. Now the question arises: should we surrender or fight for what we believe in?"
afathreat.16.d:0 "America has set its sights on us, demanding that we hand over control of our country's economy. It is uncertain whether their intentions are solely to aid in the repair of our lands or if they seek something more."
afathreat.17.t:0 "The AFA Has Stolen The West!"
afathreat.17.d:0 "The rebel state known as the AFA has stolen two of our states west of the major river line! Something must be done to reign in these war lords! Though we may not be strong enough due to our recent loss in the Mexican war we can still try."

afathreat.19.t:0 "The Federalists Have Folded!"
afathreat.19.d:0 "The Federalists have backed off and aren't even going to put up a fight. What cowards this just shows why they lost us the Mexican war. With access to the oceans we have a much higher chance of survival in this war for America."
afathreat.19.a:0 "Just Like We Planned."
afathreat.20.t:0 "The AFA Demands Our American Colonies!"
afathreat.20.d:0 "The new American government has come to us with a hard deal. They  we give up all of our American colonies for nothing in return.. what a scam!! They won't risk war for some islands and we know it!"

afathreat.24.t:0 "Drop In The Ocean"
afathreat.24.a:0 "One step foward."
afathreat.24.d:0 "British control over the western approaches will soon come to an end. The Irish people might even defect to our side entirely. Without a doubt, this operation will be a success and could potentially lead to the capture of Britain itself."
afathreatcos.1.t:0 "New England Returns Home."

CLB_enemies_on_all_sides: "Enemies On All Sides"
CLB_enemies_on_all_sides_desc: "Located in the Midwest of America, the Commonwealth of Columbia is a lone bastion of populism and true Americanism in a raging storm of conflict. Be it the Mexican snakes to our South, the British to our North and West or the Federalists and Fordists to our East, the Commonwealth truly is surrounded on all sides. Despite this, we know one thing they don't. We have the Lord God on our side, and they but the Devil to keep them company."   
CLB_beginings_of_commonwealth: "Beginnings of the Commonwealth"
CLB_beginings_of_commonwealth_desc: "Even as we begin to formalize our state, Pelley's grand economic vision for America, dubbed the Christian Commonwealth, has begun to be implemented throughout the Midwest. The Commonwealth itself is a vast overhaul of the entire American economy into a hybrid system. In this system, private businesses still exist, but they are all subservient to and part of the Commonwealth Corporation. Furthermore all banks have begun to absorbed into a Central Treasury Bank which will be responsible for distributing credit. Just only just beginning to be implemented, the Commonwealth is already beginning to have the desired effect, with a reported 7% decree in those who fit in Pelley's definition of Poverty."
CLB_the_ward_system: "The “Ward“ System"
CLB_the_ward_system_desc: "One of Pelley's most controversial policies, the Ward system functions as what many have called a form of modern slavery. In a nutshell,   those Americans identified as most impoverished (particularly Appalachian whites, deep southern blacks and Mexican immigrants) become Wards of the state and are brought under its care. However, Pelley identifies these elements as the most unproductive in society and  denies them full Commonwealth benefits, relegating them to largely labor jobs. In theory the system will be used to educate these peoples and ensure they can enter the Commonwealths workforce on an equal footing. In reality, the system has fallen under the sway of the Allenites, who abuse it, using the labor army it creates to indeed build up the Commonwealth, but at a tremendous human cost. Caring little for the Wards, the Allenites drive them in way that would make even the most harsh slave driver blush. The status of just what to do with the Wards, wither to reform the system, end it completely or simply maintain it's current implementation is one of the most divisive questions currently facing the Christian Party."   
CLB_democracy_in_limbo: "Democracy in Limbo"
CLB_democracy_in_limbo_desc: "Despite long term plans and promises to keep and even expand democracy and democratic rights, since it's formation a short time ago, Pelley's Commonwealth as of yet failed to live up to his word. Perhaps attempting to placate the Allenites or to drum up his status as the 'American Dressler,' Pelley has yet to formalize anything that even vaguely resembles democracy within his new state. Curiously, when he's pressed hard enough by the press, he still claims total loyalty the Constitution, only claiming that it needs to amended to include referendum voting on legislation. Regardless, both the various nonChristian Party political groups that exist within the Commonwealth and the people themselves wait for the time when Pelley will make true to his word, and creates a true democratic paradise here in the Midwest."
CLB_spliting_at_seems: "Spliting at the Seems"
CLB_spliting_at_seems_desc: "Be it Norris' Progressives, Coughlin and Townsend's Unionists, Smith's America Firsters or even our Allenite “allies“ within the Christian Party itself, it is clear to all that Columbia is on the verge of collapsing in on itself. To save the nation, we must take drastic action. Should we fail, §Rthe results would be bloody indeed...§!"

POLITICS_WILLLIAM_DUDLEY_PELLEY_DESC: "At age thirty-nine William Pelley was a rather unimaginative Hollywood screenwriter and journalist. His past adventures mostly consisting of visiting Russia and absorbing anti-Semitic pamphlets. By the time of his founding the Silver Legion in 1933, Pelley had cultivated his unique ideology, combining spiritualism, democracy, and faith. With Pelley's more eccentric views being reserved for trusted allies only. As America surrendered nearly a third of her land to the Mexican menace, Pelley knew the time had finally come to bring his own brand of revival to the United States. Using his connections in various Midwestern populist and progressive moments as well as keen use of the Sliver Legion, Pelley was able to carve out a sizable chunk of America for himself and his allies. Now in power, Pelley has begun at last to implement his vision for a holy and truly free America, however his rule is still far from stable. Be it his radical allies in the Allenite faction of the Christian Party, the various other populist and progressive parties within the Midwest, Pelley has his work cut out for him. If he is able to remain at the head of the Columbia or if he fails to keep the disparaging factions united remains to be seen."
CLB_RONNIE_MATSDOTTER_DESC: "Before taking his seat in office, Matsdotter proved his mettle as a battle-hardened veteran of the 3rd Mexican American war. Known for his heroic bravery and unyielding spirit, Matsdotter fearlessly fought on the front lines, taking down over 47 advancing Mexicans with precision while simultaneously providing life-saving medical aid to his fellow soldiers. Despite his impressive skills, Matsdotter was struck by artillery shelling, forcing him to be evacuated and placed on medical leave until the end of the war. His bitter resentment grew towards the undemocratic direction that the US government was taking.Once he returned to civilian life, Matsdotter formed an unlikely alliance with a devout Christian man, and together, they embarked on a mission to unite the fragmented United States. With his newfound position in the AFA and a trusted vice president by his side, Matsdotter is now on a mission to take back the American homeland, using his unparalleled courage and strategic prowess to bring the country back to its former glory."

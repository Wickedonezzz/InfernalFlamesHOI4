GRE_FUHRERREDUX_DESC: "With our successful campaign against the Turks, the dream of Megáli Idéa has been realized and our status has been secured. Our Ethnarch and incumbent leader Elefthérios Venizélos, having sidelined the opposition with his popular reforms rules with a velvet glove.\n\nHowever the abysmal economic situation, the slow economic withering of Smyrna and Hellenization policies have caused wide unrest within our country. Elections are coming, and only time will tell what will happen to the Nation of the Hellenes."

#### Political Parties ####
GRE_vanguardist_party: "KAKE"
GRE_vanguardist_party_long: "Kommounistikó Archeiomarxistikó Kómma Elládas \n§gThe Communist Archio-Marxist Party of Greece is a communist political party in Greece, active from 1934. It belongs to a subgenre of Marxism–Leninism and Trotskyism known as Archeio-Marxism (Archive-Marxism) and appears to have been the last scion of that ideology. Its leader, Dimitrios Giotopoulos, also known by his primary alias "Witte", is the leader of the KAKE. Before its formation, he had been a leader of the Greek Archio-Marxists, which had been one of the by far largest dissident communist movements in Greece during the early-to-mid-1930s, as members of Leon Trotsky's "Left Opposition". KAKE split from Trotsky's movement in 1934 after significant ideological fallout. While overshadowed by the major Communist Party, KAKE continues its activites as it waits for the proper moment to assert itself as the true successor of socialism, even though rumors claim that Giotopoulos is collaborating with the right.§!\n\n§WHead of Government:§!

Founded in 1920, Gounaris and his parliamentary candidates campaigned for the withdrawal of the Hellenic Army from Asia Minor, which it occupied under the terms of the Treaty of Sèvres in the aftermath of World War I. Failing to win the 1920 election against the Venizelists and the subsequent victory in the Greco-Turkish war, the party suffered great losses and was in the brink of dissolution, only saved through Gounaris' political maneuvering.

The EEE calls for the rejuvination of Hellas through mass mobilization against the soulless capitalist system that has plagued the minds and souls of the Greeks, through the creation of an Organic State that will foster and protect its intended people, seeking to ressurect the times of the Byzantium Empire.§!\n\n§WHead of Government:§!

##### Leader Description ####
POLITICS_PAPANASTASIOU_DESC: "Papanastasiou was born on 8 July 1876 in Tripoli. He studied law at the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens. From 1901 to 1905 he studied social sciences, law, and philosophy in Germany. In 1910 Papanastasiou was elected to the Greek Parliament for the first time. In 1916, he has joined the Provisional Government of National Defence in Thessaloniki. After the election crisis, he and other anti-monarchists published a document entitled The Republican-Democratic Manifesto. Over the following years, his list of actions targetting the supporters of the monarchy only grew. In 1935, he was elected Prime Minister of Greece. Papanastasiou announced a series of reforms, but it is unclear whether the Liberal party would remain in power for necessarily long, as the opposition to the liberals is growing every year."
POLITICS_ALEXANDROS_Z_DESC: "He was born in Athens and was the son of Thrasyvoulos Zaimis, a former Prime Minister of Greece, and Eleni Mourouzi. His brother was Asimakis Zaimis. On his father's side he was the grandson of Andreas Zaimis, another former Prime Minister of Greece, and related to the great Kalavrytan family with notable participation in the Greek War of Independence from 1821. From his mother's side he was a descendant of an important Fanariote family of the Mourozidon. His family lived in Kerpini, Kalavryta in the Achaia prefecture.\nHe studied law at the University of Athens and at the University of Heidelberg. He also attended the universities of Leipzig, Paris and Berlin.\nIn 1929 he was elected senator and then president of the Senate. With the resignation of Koundouriotis on December 9, 1929, Eleftherios Venizelsos nominated Alexandros Zaimis as the next President of the Republic. Papanastasiou and Argyropoulos opposed Zaimi's candidacy. Venizelos justified his choice for the person of Zaimis that he came from a historical family. He was also not always democratic, but he was a moderate conservative. During the voting in the joint session of the two Legislatures held at 11 in the morning of December 14, 1929, 101 senators voted out of a total of 120 and 226 deputies out of a total of 250, Zaimis was elected with 257 votes."

In 1919, he moved to Constantinople. There, he carried out his first organised involvement in the working-class movement. After the victory of Greece in the Greco-Turkish war, he moved to the Soviet Union in 1922, where Zachariadis became a member of the Komsomol. He studied at a various political and millitary institutions of the Soviet goverment, including the International Lenin School. After 3 years though, he left the Soviet Union and moved to Greece in 1925 to organise the Young Communist League of Greece (OKNE). He was imprisoned, and afterwards fled back to the Soviet Union. Zachariadis was sent back to Greece in 1931 to reorganize the KKE, and was elected a secretary of the movement. The KKE is now split into 2 factions, the Libertarians and the Socialists.

The movement become one of the largest dissident communist movements in Greece. While initially in favor of Trotsky, Giotopoulos had a fallout with mainline Trotskyism mainly over the status of Makedonia, the creation of a International alliance and the official party orientation. Giotopoulos new KAKE movement mainly stayed in the shadow of the main communist party and many accuse Giotopoulos of being too inactive or question his and his movements loyalty to the revolution altogether. Giotopoulos meanwhile seems to be waiting for the correct moment to move forward with his plans, whatever they may be."

His first entry into the international scene was with his significant role in the union of Crete with Greece. In 1909, he was invited to Athens to resolve the political deadlock and became the country's Prime Minister. Not only did he initiate constitutional and economic reforms that set the basis for the modernization of Greek society, but also reorganized both the Greek Army and the Greek Navy in preparation of future conflicts. Through his diplomatic acumen, Greece doubled its area and population with the liberation of Macedonia, Epirus, and most of the Aegean islands. In World War I (1914-1918), he brought Greece on the side of the Allies, further expanding the Greek borders. However, his pro-Allied foreign policy brought him into direct conflict with Constantine I of Greece, causing the National Schism. The Schism polarized the population between the royalists and Venizelists and the struggle for power between the two groups affected the political and social life of Greece for decades. Following the Allied victory, Venizelos secured new territorial gains, especially in Anatolia, coming close to realizing the Megali Idea.With his swift victory in the Greco-Turkish war (1919-1921), he manged to secure his position which had suffered in popularity during this time, however he was eventually ousted by monarchist sympathizers in 1933. In the Year 1935 he returned to power after the successful coup lead by Nikolaus Plastiras and began to move against prominent royalist supporters."

##### Events #####
gre.0.t: "The Second Hellenic Republic"
gre.0.d: "Greece emerged victorious from the 1912-1913 Balkan Wars with her territory almost doubled, but found iteself in a difficult international situation. In 1914 another danger would emerge from the Assasination of Franz Ferdinand, which Greece was allied with Serbia. Initially neutral, Venizelos supported participation with the Entente while the King anticipated a German victory. This led to a power struggle between Liberals and Royalists, where the King dismissed Venizelos unconstitutionally.\n\nFollowing other incidents and humiliations from the royalist Athens government, the State of National Defence was established in Thessaloniki to fight alongside the Allies. Venizelos instead of pursuing a more moderate path, decided that the monarchy had outlast its usefulness and set out to declare the Second Hellenic Republic. The division of the country lasted 9 months, as an Allied ultimatum forced the King and the Royal Family to flee in Switzerland.\n\nVenizelos returned to Athens, as head of a superficially reunified Greece, and led it to victory alongside the Allies in World War I, but also in its entanglement in the subsequent Asia Minor Campaign which led to the Partition of the Ottoman Empire and the ratification of the Treaty of Sèvres.\n\nThe following years saw success for Venizelos' Liberal Party, securing the majority in every election, reforms were pushed and the remaining royalist sentiments were purged from the Republic.\nHowever the economic situation couldn't be worse, as Smyrna doesn't have access to the raw materials of deep Anatolia and needs to rely on the other side for economic support, debts are skyrocketing and unrest starts to grow within the population. It's 1936 and with the rise of Valkism the Hellenic Republic is in a weak position. Will the nation of the Hellenes withstand against all odds?\n\n$gre.1.d$"
gre.0.a: "As Elpísoume"
gre.0.b: "What happens next?"
gre.1.t: "The Challenges Ahead"
gre.1.d: "The Second Hellenic Republic, which faces its next election in 1936, faces several challenges before then, most prominent is the simmering resentment towards the policies of the Liberals and Venizelos. Most are certain that war is coming again soon, with many groups such as the communist and the looming figures of the far-right waiting for the first moment the government makes the slightest misstep. Extremist sentiment is also on the rise, with many flocking to either side hoping to see radical changes... with the establishment fearing that doing so would only plunge the nation into anarchy yet again."
gre.1.a: "We shall not repeat past mistakes."
gre.1.b: "What path should I pick?"
gre.2.t: "Independence Day"
gre.2.d: "In 1821, Greeks rose up against the oppressive Ottoman Empire, which had occupied Greece for nearly four hundred years. Bishop Germanos of Patras boldly raised the Greek flag at the monastery of Agia Lavras, inciting the Greek revolution. While the exact date probably was not March 25th, it did occur in late March and it was gradually associated with the religious feast of the Annunciation which occurs on the same date. On the day of the Feast of the Annunciation the archangel Gabriel appeared to the maiden Mary and announced the news, she was pregnant with the divine child. Bishop Germanos chose this day to deliver a different but not unrelated message, a new spirit was about to be born in Greece."

gre.2.a: "A new spirit shall be born again!"
gre.3.d: "Independence Day is celebrated once again in [Root.GetNameDef], with crowds lining the streets in Athens and other cities, all waving the Greek flag and singing 'Ýmnos is tin Eleftherían' - the Hymn to Freedom, and the country's national anthem. Despite all the hardship the country has faced, its people are still eager to celebrate their sense of independence from those who would oppress them."

gre.16.t: "Help Arrives!"
gre.16.d: "The Continental Entente has finalized sending 1000 rifles to our Army. It is less than we anticipated but it will definitely help us in the war effort."
gre.16.a: "OK"

gre.11.t: "To Make an Example"
gre.11.d: "Devrim Tanse is an Ottoman Spy that enlisted in the Greek army only to backstab us by sending intel to the Sultanate. Thankfully he was quickly arrested by an actual Greek patriot. Today will be the end of his life and the beginning of horror in the hearts of the traitors!"
gre.11.a: "We had no choice"

gre.12.t: "The Nationalist Militia Problem"
gre.12.d: "Today is the day we possibly decide about our fate. The Golden Dawn militia has unofficially been our allies against The Empire for a very long time. This status quo has existed for a decent number of years already but it cannot anymore. The Golden Dawn demands our action now. Should we risk democracy and integrate them into our armed forces or shut them up with some weapons and and hope Greece survives the next few decades."

gre.6.t: "The Return of The King!"
gre.6.d: "Just as we promised our Great King George II has returned to Greek soil after a long time in exile. Long live the King! Long live Greece!"
gre.6.a: "The end of the republic"

gre.7.t: "'Wait, What?'"
gre.7.d: "Today a military garrison in Smyrna has received a bizarre offer from our "friends" in the Golden Dawn. They have offered a handful of military equipment for a meager price. They ignored all questions about how they even got them. What should we do with this offer? We don't even know how they got all this stuff!"
gre.7.a: "Every gun matters for our army!"
gre.7.b: "No, just NO."

gre.8.t: "Youthful Stupidity"
gre.8.d: "An unexpected problem has emerged in Greek cities. The walls of many buildings are filled with nationalist symbols and propaganda. At this point, young people are running away from school only to contribute to acts of vandalism. This seems to be a minor issue, but this year we have seen a significant increase in support for Golden Dawn. Should we intervene?"
gre.8.a: "We have to do something!"
gre.8.b: "I don't care"

gre.20.t: "An Interesting Proposition"
gre.20.d: "Ever since we crushed the Ottoman madness we have had problems managing the various rebellions in our territories in Anatolia. This problem has become even more apparent as the war is getting closer. But the solution to this problem may be simpler than we think - let's ask Golden Dawn for help! Yes, they may not be the best of friends, but this time we need someone to do what we cannot do more than ever."
gre.20.a: "Fine"
gre.20.b: "Just divert more resources to the police"

gre.13.t: "An Another Day in Thessaloniki"
gre.13.d: "The city of Thessaloniki has a large Jewish minority and, of course, with it, there are unfortunately anti-Semitic tendencies. Acts of violence against people of other nationalities are the order of the day here. We found evidence of Golden Dawn's intervention in this problem. Today another boundary was crossed. Two thugs tried to start a fire in a synagogue while shouting pro-Golden Dawn sentences. The worst thing is that there were witnesses to this situation and if the media finds out about it, we are really screwed."
gre.13.a: "Try to censor as much as you can and don't let the Golden Dawn get angry"
gre.13.b: "Blame it all on the Golden Dawn. I'm sick of this shit"

gre.14.t: "Hail Zeus!"
gre.14.d: "No one has treated the Ancient Greek religion seriously. No one will ever think about taking it back from the land of death, right? Wrong. The "Association of Hellenism" is growing every year. They have gathered all the known ancient beliefs and compressed them into one religious canon called "Hellenism". Maybe we should recognize our ancient beliefs as an official religion in Greece? On the other hand, the Christian majority of Greece could get very angry with our recognition."
gre.14.a: "Come on, we can convince Christians of our good will"
gre.14.b: "You'd better find a good psycho facility for them instead"

gre.15.t: "The End"
gre.15.d: "We have made a mistake. A mistake that will cost thousands of lives. Golden Dawn has stormed government buildings in Athens, effectively taking control of the city. A few hours and the Republic will be gone. We can't fight anymore. Soldiers loyal to the Republic will start guerrilla warfare against the nationalists. The Entente knows about the situation, but it looks like it is not in their interest to intervene."
gre.15.a: "Glory to the Greek Underground State!"

gre.23.t: "The Coup"
gre.23.d: "The Golden Dawn, a political party known for its far-right ideology, recently gained control of the government through a coup, overthrowing the previous administration. Their ascent to power was met with mixed reactions, as their policies and actions have been a subject of controversy.\nHowever, tensions escalated further when the EEE (National Union "Hellas"), a rival political faction, decided to stage their own coup against the newly established Golden Dawn government. With the EEE aiming to seize power, the stakes were high, and the outcome of this power struggle was uncertain.\nThe EEE's coup attempt drew attention and support from various segments of society dissatisfied with the Golden Dawn's rise to power. These dissidents hoped that the EEE's coup would succeed in toppling the government, bringing about a change in leadership and policies.\nAs the coup unfolded, the nation faced a period of heightened political instability and unrest. The streets were filled with protesters, both supporting and opposing the coup attempts, leading to clashes and demonstrations throughout the country. The military's stance in this power struggle became crucial, as their loyalty could sway the balance of power.\News outlets closely followed the events, speculating on the potential outcomes and implications of the coup. International observers expressed concerns about the situation, monitoring the developments and considering potential responses.\nHowever, due to the complexity and fluidity of coup attempts, it is challenging to determine the exact outcome. The fate of the EEE's coup against the Golden Dawn government remains uncertain, and the country holds its breath, waiting to see if the new administration will be overthrown or if the Golden Dawn will successfully quell the rebellion and maintain their grip on power."
gre.23.a: "The Golden Dawn successfully quelled the rebellion"
gre.23.b: "The EEE managed to overthrow the government"

gre.24.t: "The Greco-Serbian Mutual Defence Agreement"
gre.24.d: "The Greek Foreign Minister sent delegations to Serbia to sign a mutual defense agreement, emphasizing their strong alliance. After extensive negotiations, the Serbian government accepted the agreement, recognizing its importance for shared security and regional stability. The signing ceremony marked a milestone in bilateral relations, solidifying their commitment to support each other in times of need. This agreement established frameworks for military cooperation, joint exercises, information sharing, and coordinated defense strategies between the two countries."
gre.24.a: "Rejoice!"

gre.25.t: "The Greco-Serbian Mutual Defence Agreement"
gre.25.d: "Despite efforts made by the Greek Foreign Minister to strengthen the alliance between Greece and Serbia, the Serbian government ultimately refused to sign the proposed mutual defense agreement. Despite the recognition of their shared interests as allies, Serbia expressed reservations or concerns that prevented them from accepting the agreement at that time. As a result, the signing ceremony did not take place, leaving the defense cooperation between the two countries in a state of uncertainty."
gre.25.b: "Damn"

gre.37.t: "Zaimis Dead"
gre.37.d: "The Austrian Ambassador delivered somber news today, announcing the passing of President Alexandros Zaimis of the Republic at 3:30 am. President Zaimis had been transported to Vienna for ophthalmological treatment, although it remains uncertain if this was directly related to his death. Speculations vary, with some suggesting foul play while others believe it was due to natural causes. In response, our Ethnarch Eleftherios Venizelos, who serves as the Prime Minister of Hellas, addressed the nation, informing them of the President's demise. Acting swiftly, Venizelos has assumed both the role of President and Prime Minister, maintaining control until the Liberal Committee convenes to determine the next President. There are rumors circulating that an election may not take place and instead a new President will be appointed. Many fear that this unfortunate event may mark the beginning of the end for the republic, as there is a concern that extremists and ultranationalists might exploit the situation and attempt to seize power through a coup. The fragility of the current political landscape has heightened apprehensions about the future stability of the nation. It is a time of uncertainty and heightened vigilance as the country navigates through this challenging period."

gre.38.t: "The Snap 1936 Presidential Elections"
gre.38.d: "Snap presidential elections are to be held today, after the loss of Alexandros Zaimis. The Kalpes closed at 7pm, and the winner finnaly turned out to be:"
gre.38.a: "...Georgios Athanasiadis-Novas"
gre.38.b: "...Ioannis Rallis"
gre.38.c: "...Dimitris Glinos"

gre.39.t: "The conference on the definition of Metaxism"
gre.39.d: "Today, Metaxas convened a conference to discuss the definition of Metaxism, titled "Declaration of the Ideological Principles of Metaxism." The core tenets of Metaxism were originally outlined in the 1930s in a book called "The Metaxism Manifesto." This ideology can be summarized as a Greek nationalist authoritarian ideology associated with Ioannis Metaxas, aimed at revitalizing the Greek nation and establishing a modern, culturally unified Hellenic Nation.\nMetaxism critiques Liberalism and individualism while drawing inspiration from elements commonly found in Valkist or National Populist movements. Its objective is to mobilize the Greek population as a disciplined collective in service of creating a new Hellenic State. Although some aspects of Metaxism align with National Populist ideologies, academically it is considered a distinct form of autocratic governance, incorporating principles from classical Conservatism, Monarchism, Valkism, and National Populist movements. The concept of the Third Greek Civilization, following the ancient Greek and Byzantine civilizations, serves as a unifying idea within Metaxism, albeit with differing interpretations among its various strains.\n\nNow, Metaxas aims to deepen the ideology of Metaxism. Which direction should he prioritize: Monarchism, National Populism, or Valkism?"
gre.39.a: "Valkism and the 1st Hellenic Civilisation"

gre.40.t: "An Interesting Proposal"
gre.40.d: "As tensions escalate, the President of [GRE.GetName], [GRE.GetLeader], has reached a critical decision: to launch an attack on the Serbs. This outcome doesn't come as a surprise to many of us, as it has been a looming possibility. However, amidst this impending conflict, an intriguing alternative looms on the horizon—an opportunity to pursue a different path.\nCould we not, instead, seek an alliance with the Serbs and establish the visionary Greco-Serbian Confederation? The Serbs have long been our friends, and we share a common religion, reinforcing the deep-rooted bonds between our nations. It is a choice that demands our contemplation.\nBy embracing the Greco-Serbian Confederation, we can unlock tremendous potential. Collaboration, unity, and shared prosperity could flourish as we work hand in hand. Rather than engaging in military confrontation, we could foster diplomacy, economic cooperation, and cultural exchange. Our combined strengths and resources could transform us into a formidable force, ensuring stability and advancing our shared interests.\nNaturally, making such a monumental decision requires careful consideration of the risks and rewards at stake. We must seek a comprehensive understanding of the president's motivations for pursuing this attack on the Serbs. The complex web of international relations and geopolitical dynamics demands a judicious approach to address our nation's challenges and aspirations effectively.\nIt is incumbent upon us to engage in open and constructive dialogue, exploring alternative paths and advocating for a thorough examination of all options. By delving into the possibilities inherent in the Greco-Serbian Confederation and actively participating in shaping our nation's destiny, we can contribute to a more harmonious and prosperous future.\nWhat should we do?"
gre.40.a: "Who cares, launch the invasion as planned"
gre.40.b: "Perhaps, this is a true argument. Let's start the talks."

gre.41.t: "Greco-Serbian Confenderation, Round 1"
gre.41.d: "The long-awaited talks between the Greek and Serbian delegations commenced today, marking a significant step towards shaping the proposed union. The atmosphere in the negotiation room was charged with anticipation and a shared desire for progress.\nThe Greek delegation wasted no time in emphasizing the importance of recognizing and safeguarding the rights of minorities within Serbia. They stressed the need for Serbia to acknowledge and respect the diverse cultural and ethnic identities present within its borders. This call for inclusivity aimed to foster an environment of equality and harmony within the potential union.\nFurthermore, Greece proposed the involvement of Croatian and Slovenian representatives in the talks. By including these neighboring parties, Greece sought to ensure that all regions in the vicinity felt equally valued and included in the decision-making process. The intention was to avoid any potential feelings of abandonment or resentment that might lead to future conflicts. The Serbian delegates cautiously acknowledged this proposal, expressing their willingness to explore the possibility of involving additional stakeholders.\nThe hopes for a successful outcome of the talks soared as it became evident that both delegations were committed to the shared vision of the union. The negotiations took on a spirit of cooperation and understanding, as compromises were considered and mutual agreements began to take shape.\nAs the day drew to a close, the delegates adjourned, carrying with them a renewed sense of purpose and a commitment to advancing the negotiations. The talks had made tangible progress, laying the groundwork for a Greco-Serbian union that held the potential to transcend boundaries and elevate the collective well-being of both nations."
gre.41.a: "The union is closer and closer to happening"

gre.42.t: "Greco-Serbian Confenderation, Round 2"
gre.42.d: "The sun rises on a new day, brimming with optimism and the promise of progress, as the discussions on the Greco-Serbian union continue. A sense of excitement permeates the negotiation room, as the Greek delegation receives encouraging news—their proposals have been accepted.\nThe Serbian delegation acknowledges the importance of recognizing and upholding the rights of minorities within their country. With a newfound understanding, they commit to taking tangible steps towards fostering inclusivity and respect for diverse cultural and ethnic identities. This breakthrough instills a renewed sense of hope, as the foundation for a more harmonious and equitable union begins to take shape.\nIn a significant development, the Croatian and Slovenian delegations join the talks, answering Greece's call for broader participation. Their inclusion not only acknowledges the importance of their perspectives but also ensures that all relevant regional stakeholders have a voice in shaping the future. The delegates from Croatia and Slovenia contribute their insights and concerns, emphasizing the need for regional cooperation and solidarity.\nAs the negotiations progress, the discussions expand to encompass a myriad of topics. Economic integration plans are explored, with a focus on fostering trade, investment, and shared prosperity. Cultural collaboration becomes a central theme, with efforts to preserve and celebrate the rich heritage and traditions of all participating nations. Political alignment is discussed, aiming to establish a framework that ensures mutual support and cooperation on regional and international matters.\nHope is on the very high for citizens of both countries."
gre.42.a: "Communist, Communist, Communist you shall be!"

gre.43.t: "Greco-Serbian Confenderation, Round 3"
gre.43.d: "The next day dawns with an air of anticipation and excitement, as the vision of a Greco-Serbian Confederation finally materializes. The negotiation room is abuzz with energy as delegates from Greece, Serbia, Croatia, and Slovenia gather to solidify the agreements that will shape the future of their interconnected nations.\nThe atmosphere is charged with a sense of accomplishment, as the final details are meticulously reviewed and fine-tuned. Each delegation brings forth their unwavering commitment to the principles of unity, cooperation, and shared prosperity. Through extensive dialogue, compromises, and a genuine spirit of collaboration, the foundation for a historic confederation is laid.\nThe moment arrives when the representatives affix their signatures to the official documents, symbolizing the birth of a new era. A profound sense of pride washes over the room as the ink dries, signifying the unity of diverse cultures, histories, and aspirations. Applause resonates, punctuating the significance of this momentous occasion.\nThe Greco-Serbian Confederation, spanning across borders and bridging differences, is now a reality. The confederation embodies the spirit of mutual respect, trust, and collective progress. It establishes a framework for political, economic, and cultural integration that will shape the region for generations to come."
gre.43.a: "United, at last"

gre.44.t: "The first crisis of the Confenderation"
gre.44.d: "The first crisis of the newly formed Greek-Yugoslav Confederation emerges as tensions between the Croat and Slovene communities and the central government reach a boiling point. Grievances about inadequate representation and a perception of being marginalized have escalated, leading to clashes and unrest in Zagreb and Ljubljana.\nIn the aftermath of these disturbing events, a sense of urgency grips the confederation's leadership. The government is faced with a critical decision that could define the future of the union: whether to accept the demands of the Croat and Slovene communities and rename the confederation to the Greco-Yugoslav Confederation and grant some autonomy, or to reject their pleas and risk further escalation of the crisis.\nAmidst the intense clashes, a potential compromise begins to emerge.

gre.45.t: "Eleftherios Venizelos has Passed Away"
gre.45.d: "Greece mourns the loss of a titan in its political history, Prime Minister Eleftherios Kyriakou Venizelos, who peacefully passed away in his home. As the leader of the Venizelists, he dedicated his life to serving his country and empowering it on the international stage. His contributions to Greece were not only transformative but also visionary, leaving an indelible mark on the nation's history.\nWords alone cannot fully express the profound impact Venizelos had on Greece and its people. He was not only an architect of the nation but a driving force behind its progress and development. One of his most remarkable achievements was leading Greece to victory in the Greco-Turkish War, a testament to his strategic brilliance and unwavering determination. By humbling the Turks, he solidified Greece's position as a regional power and earned the admiration and respect of his countrymen.\nVenizelos was not just a political figure; he was a revolutionary, a statesman, and a true pioneer in his field. His visionary leadership and bold ideas laid the foundation for modern Greece, shaping its political landscape and setting it on a path of prosperity. As the Ethnarch, he embodied the spirit of the nation, fiercely dedicated to the welfare of his people and the advancement of their interests.\nIn the wake of his passing, a week of mourning has been declared by our new caretaker Prime Minister, who has taken over the helm. As the nation grieves, it is essential to remember Venizelos as the uncompromising lionheart that he was. His legacy will continue to inspire future generations of Greeks to strive for greatness and to work tirelessly for the betterment of our beloved country. The loss of Eleftherios Venizelos is not just a personal tragedy; it is a loss for the entire nation. We shall honor his memory by cherishing his contributions and accomplishments, recognizing that his life's work has left an indelible imprint on Greece's history and identity. May his spirit guide us as we move forward into the future he helped create for us. Eleftherios Venizelos will forever be remembered as a visionary statesman and a national icon, whose legacy will continue to inspire and shape Greece's destiny for generations to come."

The responsibility to uphold the legacy of progressive reforms and foster stability falls upon the shoulders of the committee members as they consider the two prominent candidates: Sofoklis Venizelos and Themistoklis Sofoulis.\nSofoklis Venizelos carries the weight of his father's vision and dedication to progress. He pledges to build upon the accomplishments of the previous administration and further advance our society. With his passion and understanding of governance, Sofoklis aims to create a more inclusive and prosperous future for our nation.\nMeanwhile, Themistoklis Sofoulis brings a different approach to the table. His experience and pragmatism have earned him respect across party lines. He is seen as a unifying figure who can navigate complex political situations and ensure stability during uncertain times.\nThe liberal committee faces a challenging decision, torn between continuity and stability. Sofoklis Venizelos represents the promise of carrying on a legacy, while Themistoklis Sofoulis embodies the wisdom of experience. The committee must carefully consider the pressing issues at hand and envision the type of leader who can effectively address them.\nUltimately, the chosen Prime Minister will have the responsibility to guide our nation through these transformative times.
